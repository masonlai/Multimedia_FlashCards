# Multimedia_FlashCards

### The traditional FlashCards are only supporting strings for the card's back. However, a lot of research proved that some people are good at learning through image or sound. As a result, this project is to develop a FlashCard web application. The front-end is using reactJS and the backend is using java spring boot.
